- **<u>Interactive Inputs</u>**: Adjust the starting balance, win rate, risk percentage, risk-to-reward ratio, number of trades, and number of simulations using intuitive sliders.
- **<u>Quick Simulation</u>**: Instantly see the impact of your input parameters on the equity curve with dynamic simulations.
- **<u>Visual Representation</u>**: View multiple equity curves on a single graph to compare different simulations and identify patterns.
- **<u>User-Friendly Interface</u>**: Enjoy a modern and responsive design, making it easy to navigate and use.

## How It Works
1. **<u>Starting Balance</u>**: Set the initial amount of capital you want to start with.
2. **<u>Win Rate</u>**: Define the percentage of trades you expect to win.
3. **<u>Risk Percentage</u>**: Choose the percentage of your capital you are willing to risk per trade.
4. **<u>Risk-to-Reward Ratio</u>**: Specify the ratio of potential profit to potential loss for each trade.
5. **<u>Number of Trades</u>**: Determine the number of trades to simulate.
6. **<u>Number of Simulations</u>**: Select how many different simulations you want to run to compare potential outcomes.

## Purpose
The Equity Curve Simulator helps traders evaluate the robustness and viability of their trading strategies by simulating the financial outcomes over a series of trades.
